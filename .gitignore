# Entity Framework Core migrations history
# This is crucial! Never commit your database migration snapshots.
# Only the C# migration files themselves should be tracked.
# The actual database snapshot files can change with every migration.
# The default location is `Migrations/{DbContextName}ModelSnapshot.cs`
# You usually DO want to keep the migration files (e.g., InitialCreate.cs),
# but not the compiled outputs or temporary files.
# The .cs files for migrations should be tracked, but the snapshot data often causes issues if it's the exact compiled output.
# The general rule is: commit your Migrations/<timestamp>_MigrationName.cs files
# but DO NOT commit the snapshot or compiled output.
# If you regenerate a migration, you might get a new snapshot.

# Specific to your project:
# .env file for local environment variables (Supabase keys, connection strings, etc.)
.env

# User Secrets (for local development sensitive data)
# These are outside your project directory in your user profile
# so you don't typically need a specific entry here unless you move them.
# The 'dotnet user-secrets' command handles their placement.
